## Getting started with Local Development üíª

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) for building, running and deploying the project
- [Harvest account](https://www.getharvest.com/) where the time tracking is done, the source of data

### Installing and Running

First, install third party dependencies

```
npm install
```

Set up the `.env` file with proper values

```sh
cp .env.example .env
code .env # or alternative editor
```

Start the project locally

```
npm run start
```

You should now have the project running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! ‚ú®

### Quality Assurance

This project relies heavily on unit tests with `jest` and has 100% coverage! Additionally [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) helps with code style consistency and [`ESLint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) guides some code style decisions.

Run the tests by running one of

```
npm run test
npm run test -- --watch
npm run test -- --watch --notify
```

Check the code style by running

```
npm run lint
```

Fix the code style issues manually or together with thw following commands

```
npm run lint -- --fix
npm run prettier
```

## Deployment üå©Ô∏è

To set up a deployment on AWS you need to configure serverless, make sure the values in `.env` are correct and then run deploy commands.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) for building, running and deploying the project
- [Harvest account](https://www.getharvest.com/) where the time tracking is done, the source of data
- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) for hosting the serverless function (lambda)

### Installing and Deploying

First, install third party dependencies

```
npm install
```

Set up the `.env` file with proper values

```sh
cp .env.example .env
code .env # or alternative editor
```

Configure AWS credentials in `serverless`.

```
npx serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --secret wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

To deploy both a dev environment and a prod environment, run

```
npm run deploy
```

(As an alternative you can run `npm run deploy:dev` or `npm run deploy:prod`)

### Clean up

To remove everything that was set up on AWS, run

```
npm run remove-deploys
```
